# FAQ
###### (in all honesty no one actually asked these questions but they did seem relevant)

## what is this?
Clicks is a semi-passive game made in Kotlin. The twist is that you get granular control over (almost) every aspect of the core game mechanics!

## when will development be finished?
Honestly difficult to say; I work on it as I feel inspiration, plus life obligations. So..... eventually!

## how long is the game?
The most "efficient" way to play is probably to run it in the background and interact once in a while. As for the play time, technically speaking you could play for a very long time with the prestige system.

## how do I play?
Check out the [playing guide](guide.md)! The guide version corresponds with the version of the game you have installed. Or, use the [remote repository](https://github.com/willowyx/clicks/blob/main/guide.md) for the most recent version of the guide.

## what new features can I expect?
These features **will** be implemented by the 1.0 release:

* save/load system
* connect interface actions
* new mods
* prestige system
* game & visual polish
* some sort of onboarding?

As I think of other things I will add them to this "roadmap" but the current list will not get smaller.

## can I grab code from this?
Yes

# building clicks

## Java version
clicks requires JDK 21, whether you are building or running the game, although I've tested with JDK 25 as well which works fine.

## on mac
on Mac, clicks may require these JVM options to run correctly:
* `-XstartOnFirstThread`
* `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED`
