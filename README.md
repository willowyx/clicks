# FAQ
###### (in all honesty no one actually asked these questions but they did seem relevant)

## what is this?
Clicks is a semi-passive game made in Kotlin. The twist is that you get granular control over every aspect of the core game mechanics!

## when will development be finished?
Honestly difficult to say; I work on it such that I don't get bored, plus life obligations. So..... eventually!

## is there a story?
No, I'm not planning on adding a story.

## how long is the game?
The most "efficient" way to play is probably to run it in the background and interact once in a while. As for the play time, technically speaking you could play for a very, very long time with the prestige system.

## how do I play?
Check out the [playing guide](guide.md) included locally! The guide version corresponds with the version of the game you have installed. Or, use the [remote repository](https://github.com/willowyx/clicks/blob/main/guide.md) for the most recent version of the guide.

## what new features can I expect?
These features **will** be implemented by the 1.0 release:

* save/load system
* a number of new mods
* prestige system
* game & visual polish

As I think of other things I will add them to this "roadmap" but the current list will not get smaller.

## can I grab code from this?
Do literally whatever you want with it. Just remember to do the standard MIT license stuff.
